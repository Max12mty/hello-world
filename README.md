# hello-world
first repository attempt

Hi everyone!

I´m Max! I´m a Business Intelligence Analyst in Mexico, I live with my girlfriend and our 2 dogs and I make the best Cantaritos in the world!

Right now I´m new at coding in Python and I would love to learn about Github on paralel, so here I´m.

Wish me luck!
